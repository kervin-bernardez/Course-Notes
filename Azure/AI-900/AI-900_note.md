## Machine Learning

### Automated Machine Learning

Supervised Training Models
- Classification 
- Regression
- Time series forecasting

Explain Best Selected Model
- Calculates feature importance for the best model
- Determines the influence of each feature on the predicted label

Blocked Algorithms
- Block selected Algorithms
- Gives control on time

Exit Criterion
- Training job time (hours)
- Metric score threshold

### Evaluated Model - Regression

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) : The average difference between predicted values and true values.
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) : The square root of the mean squared difference between predicted values and true values.
- Relative Squared Error (RSE) : A relative metric between 0 and 1 based on the square of the difference between predicted values and true values.
- Relative Absolute Error (RAE) : A relative metric between 0 and 1 based on the difference between predicted values and true values.
- Coefficient of Determination (R^2) : This metric summarize how much of the variance between predicted values and true values.

### Evaluation Model - Classification

![Confusion Matrix](Pics/confusion_matrix.png)

- Accuracy : The ration of correct predictions (TP + TN) to the total number of predictions.
- Precision : The fraction of positive cases correctly identified. (TP / (TP+FP))
- Recall : The fraction of the cases classified as positive that are actually positive. (TP/(TP+FN))
- F1 Score : An overall metric that essentially combines precision and recall.
- AUC (Area Under the Cover) : Binary Classification = 0.5 indicates random result, 1 - indicated best fit.

### Evaluation Model - Clustering

- Average Distance to Other Center : This indicates how close, on average, each point in the cluster is to the centroids of all other clusters.
- Average Distance to Cluster Center : This indicates how close, on average, each point in the cluster is to the centroid of the cluster.
- Number of Points : The number of points assigned to the cluster.
- Maximum Distance to Cluster Center : The max distance between each point and the centroid of that points cluster. If this number is high, the cluster may be widely dispersed. This statistic in combination with the Average Distance to Cluster Center helps determine the cluster's spread.
- Combined evaluation

## Computer Vision

### CV - Key Elements

Image Classification 

Object detection

Semantic segmentation

Image analysis

Face detection, analysis, and recognition

Optical Character recognition (OCR)

### Computer Vision Services

- Computer Vision : You can use this service to analyze images and video, and extract descriptions, tags, objects, and text.
- Custom Vision : Use this service to train custom image classification and object detection models using your own images.
- Face : The face service enable you to build face detection and facial recognition solutions.
- Form Recognizer : Use this service to extract information from scanned forms and invoices.

### Computer Vision

Features:
- Interpret an image and suggest an appropriate caption
- Suggest relevant tags that could be used to index an image
- Categorize an image
- Identify object in an image
- Detect faces and people in an image
- Recognize celebrities and landmarks in an image
- Read text in an image
- - Optical Character recognition (OCR) : to recognize individual shapes as letters, numerals, punctuation, or other elements of text.
- - Machine Reading Comprehension (MCR) : not only reads the text characters, but can use a semantic model to interpret the text is about

OCR API
- For small amounts of text in images
- Works synchronously
- Info returned:
- - Regions in the image that contains text
- - Lines of text in each region
- - Words in each line of text 

The Read API
- For scanned documents that have a lot of text
- Works asynchronously
- Info returned:
- - Pages : One for each page of text, including information about the page size and orientation
- - Lines : The lines of text on a page
- - Words : The words on a line of text

### Custom Vision

Features:
- Image Classification : applies one or more labels to an image
- Object detection : is similar, but it also returns the coordinates on the image where the applied labels can be found

Model evaluation metrics:
- Precision : What percentage of the class predictions made by the model were correct?
- Recall : What percentage of the class predictions did the model correctly identify?
- Average Precision : An overall metric that takes into account bot precision and recall 

### Face

Features:
- Face Detection
- Face Verification
- Find Similar Faces
- Group faces based on similarities
- Identify people

Face Detection Attributes
- Face Emotion Detection : happiness, sadness, neutral, anger, contempt, disgust, surprise, and fear
- Makeup Detection : Whether the face has makeup. This attribute returns a Boolean value for eyeMakeup and lipMakeup. 

Images for most accurate recognition results:
- JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP
- Image file no larger than 6MB
- When you create Person object, use photos that feature different kinds of angle and lighting
- Some faces might not be recognized because of technical challenges such as:
- - images with extreme lighting
- - obstruction that blocks one or both eyes
- - changes in hair type or facial hair
- - changes in facial appearance because of age
- - extreme facial expressions

### Form Recognizer

Model Supported 
- A pre-build receipt model that provide out-of-the-box, and is trained to recognize and extract data from sales receipts.
- Custom model which enable you to extract what are known key/value pairs and table data forms.

For best results when using a custom model :
- JPG, PNG, BMP, PDF, or TIFF formats
- Files size not larger than 50MB
- Image size between 50 x 50 px and 10,000 x 10,000 px
- Pdf documents no larger than 17 x 17 inches

Information from the receipt slip:
- time of transaction
- date of transaction
- merchant information
- taxes paid
- receipt totals
- other pertinent information that may be present on the receipt
- all text on the receipt is recognized and returned as well
