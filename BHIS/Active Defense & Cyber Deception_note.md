# Active Defense and Cyber Deception

Description

## Definition and Diclaimer

Active Defense : Defense that "responds"

Passive Defense : Prevention | Detection | Response

Cyber Deception : Increase attacker "work effort"

### What is Offensive Countermeasures?

- Offensive countermeasures employs offensive techniques as agressors attack but in a defensive posture.

- Think poison, not venom.

- Always ensure solid legal foothing. (Proper authorization, warrant, written approval)

- Detection time + Reaction time < Attack time

### What is Cyber Deceptions?

- Cyber Deceptions is the deliberate and calculated process of deceiving attacks in an effort to wage a better defense

## How to not get burned

### Basic setup 

- Setup the server via name/e-mail that is not a real person

- Register all this through a non-attributable e-mail/paypay/domain/hosting

### Non-Attributable E-mail

- Avoid Google/Microsoft

- Use ProtonMail

- Verify all registration using this email

- Use a very strong passphrase/password

- Use famous place that has nothing to do with you in any way

### Hosting/Doamin Providers

- Create your non-attributable instance and prepare to destroy it

- Provider need to accept Paypal or prepaid gift cards

### Burner Phones

- Essential to confirm account details

- Can be purchased from about anywhere

### Paying

- Do not use personal/corporate credit card

- Pay with cash

- $100 - $500 enough for 2-6 months

### Honeypots

Object that is intended to be interacted with by an attacker, not legitimate users

Ideally, it should resemble something valuable to you and or your organizatio

Focus on:

- Identifying machine internal systems and users

- Identidying attacks that AV and IDS miss

- Our incident-handling procedures

Fail2Ban

Scans log files (e.g.Â /var/log/auth_log) and bans IPs that show the malicious signs -- too many password failures, seeking for exploits, etc.

[Fail2ban Webpage](https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)

DenyHosts 

A utility developed by Phil Schwartz and maintained by a number of developers which aims to thwart sshd (ssh server) brute force attacks.

### Honeyports

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Started"

while [1]
do 
    IP=`nc -nlv 1025 2>&1 1> /dev/null | grep received | awk -F '[] []' '{print $3;}'`
    IPTABLES -A INPUT -P tcp -s $IP -j DROP
    echo -- $IP has been bloocked!
done
```

### Portspoof

Cowrie

A medium to high interaction SSH and Telnet honeypot designed to log brute force attacks and the shell interaction performed by the attacker. 

[Cowrie Github](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie)

Artillery

A combination of a honeypot, monitoring tool, and alerting system.

[Artillery Github](https://github.com/BinaryDefense/artillery)

### More Evil Web Servers

SNARE

A web application honeypot sensor attracting all sort of maliciousness from the Internet.

[SNARE Github](https://github.com/mushorg/snare)

### Application Specific Honeypots

SCADA System

## Attribution

Know what they are after

Undersahtnd what they already have

### Dealing with TOR

![TOR](Pics/tor.png)

TOR is not just used by browsers

SOCKS-5 and proxychains might be in play

Usefull for nmap scans

```
proxychains nmap -PN -sT -p 80 <IP>
```

### Honeytokens

Canarytokens helps track activity and actions on your network.

### Word Web Bugs (Honeydocs)

asd

### Infinetely Recursive Windows Directory

Stops RANSOMWARE

```
cd \
mkdir \goaway
cd goaway
mklink /D dir1 c:\goaway\
mklink /D dir2 c:\goaway\
```
